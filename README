LocalizedLabel
==============

ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper.label should localize the content if the text argument is nil.
This issue was already reported:
 http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/745
 http://i18n.lighthouseapp.com/projects/14948-rails-i18n/tickets/10-form-label-should-use-i18n
but if you are impatient like me use this plugin till official resolution is released.


Example
=======

config/ja.yml:
  ja:
    activerecord:
      attributes:
        user:
          name: 名前

 <% label "user", "name" %>
 # => <label for="user_name">名前</label>
